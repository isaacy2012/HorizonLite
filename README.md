### Horizon Lite is a simple streak-based task manager for Android
It encourages good habits by making users input tasks today and to complete them to keep their streak. Once a task is added it **cannot** be deleted, so one must complete the task or risk losing their streak. Over time, users will learn not to set an unrealistic number of tasks for the day. 

## Features
- Adding and checking off tasks

- Streak counter to encourage good habits

- Add task back from archive
